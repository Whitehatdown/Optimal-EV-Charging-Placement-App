### About this Project:  

The global transportation industry has long struggled with the environmental consequences of running on internal combustion engines (ICEs) and their harmful contributions to climate change. With deleterious consequences for the environment, as fossil fuels diminish and greenhouse gas emissions, in particular carbon dioxide, raised alarm over climate change — just how immediately we should approach it is a question. It is clear from these discussions that there is a growing focus to move away from traditional fuels and the corresponding development of more sustainable options such as electric vehicles (EVs). With electricity from renewable sources, their tailpipe emissions are zero and by this way of transportation greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced tremendously. The shift towards EVs is gaining momentum thanks to plunging battery prices and the development of new charging technology. For EVs to develop into a viable mainstream alternative, however, greater public charging infrastructure is necessary; these are strategic placements of EV Charging Stations (EVCS).

In our project, we focused on the following goals:

1) Understanding Demand: We explored how geographical and socio-economic factors can help us gauge the demand for EV charging stations.
2) Dataset Creation: We aimed to develop a comprehensive dataset that reflects the socio-demographic characteristics of Germany.
3) Optimal Placement: We tackled the challenge of identifying the best locations for EV charging stations using traditional machine learning (ML) techniques.
4) Model Assessment: We evaluated various ML models and compared their effectiveness to find the most suitable approach.
Practical Applications: Our findings aim to improve understanding of optimal EVCS placement and support automated decision-making for expanding EV charging infrastructure.

### Dashboard
This dashboard is built on Streamlit, a Python library designed for open-source interactive web applications and hosted on Hugging Face. Our dashboard shows the map of Saarbrücken, Germany, with the points-of-interest, existing EV charging stations, residential and commercial places, and the optimal location of new EV charging stations predicted by the model marked on the map. The app provides one with an interactive view of some features that were either collected and used for training the model, as well as final results and exploratory data analysis graphs such as a pie chart of the number of different types of infrastructure in Saarbrücken-based examples, in order to render the data in order for model performance analysis and visualization.
